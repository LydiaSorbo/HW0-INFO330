**PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL (<https://www.postgresql.org/>) is an open-source object-relational database management system. PostgreSQL can be deployed on-premises, on a cloud provider, or as a database-as-a-service. Java and Python can access PostgreSQL using PL/Java and PL/Python (plpython3u), respectively.
