**Apache Cassandra**

Apache Cassandra (<https://cassandra.apache.org/>) is an open-source
NoSQL key-value store database. Cassandra can be hosted on-premises, on
the cloud, or in a combination of these ways (hybrid model). Java and
Python can both access Cassandra through datastax and Java can access
through five other additional drivers.
