**Microsoft SQL Server**

Microsoft SQL Server (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/>) is
a commercial relational database management system. SQL Server can be
deployed on-premises, on a cloud provider, or as a database-as-a-service
with Azure. Java and Python can access SQL Server using JDBC and pyodbc
or pymssql, respectively.
