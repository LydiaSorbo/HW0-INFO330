**Stardog (Extra Credit)**

Stardog is ([**https://www.stardog.com/**](https://www.stardog.com/)) is a commercial RDF (knowledge) graph database management system. In contrast to a relational database which stores data in tables, Stardog uses knowledge graphs which store data in a network of interconnected points. Knowledge graphs differ from standard graph data management in their use of triples (subject-object-predicate statements) which are able to represent complex relationships with increased flexibility. Stardog can be hosted on-premises or on a cloud provider, and can also be a managed service through Stardog Enterprise. Java and Python can access Stardog using the Stardog Java API and the Stardog Python API, respectively.
